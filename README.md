# Publish your website

## Publish with Atlantis

Open Publish in Studio, choose your website name and publish. Open Variables in Studio to set public frontend values, including TOKEN_CA and your deployed BACKEND_URL if needed. Automatic CA filling is off unless you explicitly enable it; when enabled, connected fields update after the first confirmed coin launch from this project. Publish changes again when your website edits are ready. If hosted publishing is unavailable, use GitHub below.

## GitHub Pages

1. In Studio, connect GitHub and export the frontend. Choose Public for the simplest GitHub Pages setup.
2. Open the new repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New repository variable.
3. Name it TOKEN_CA, paste your real token contract/mint address into Value, then click Add variable. Leave it blank until your token launches.
4. Go to Settings → Pages → Source and choose GitHub Actions.
5. Go to Actions → Publish website → Run workflow. Open the website link when it finishes.

Changing a variable? Run Publish website again. These values are public.

## Local or ZIP setup

1. Edit the public values in config.js, or copy .env.example to .env and run node --env-file=.env scripts/configure.mjs with Node 22+.
2. Serve this directory using a static web server.
